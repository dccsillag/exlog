# microlog

A package for experiment logging in Python.

Features include:

- Stores relevant source code (only what is necessary) with the experiments automatically;
- Easily fetch the experiments that generated a given file;
- Easily fetch the experiments that were generated by a given script;
- Shouldn't use tons of storage;
- Everything runs locally -- no possibly-sketchy third-party will be getting aceess to your code and experiments.

## Example usage

The following example trains a model and registers an experiment that outputed the file `trained_model.pth`:

```python
from microlog import expath
import pickle


...  # your experiment, yada yada yada
model = ...
...  # your experiment, yada yada yada

model.save(expath("trained_model.pth"))
```

Note that you only needed to import the module and use the `expath` function here. Everything else is neatly encapsulated in the `microlog.internals` module.

We also provide **(NOTE: TODO)** utils for dealing with PyTorch (and Keras?) models directly, so the code can become:

```python
from microlog import expath, add_model


...  # your experiment, yada yada yada
model = ...
...  # your experiment, yada yada yada

add_model(model).save(expath("trained_model.pth"))
```

The code above, although containing a little bit more code, will also log training history data, model predictions, metrics, etc.

## Documentation

The documentation can be generated using `pdoc3`. For example:

```sh
pip install pdoc3
pdoc --html .
```
